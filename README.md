Story of File in Dropbox
===========

A simple pythons script which simply get all versions of a specified file in Dropbox, compute some statistics (word count) and save statistics to a CSV file with time stamps. [getAllVersions.py]

Script utilizes the Dropbox API, and it can be reached through https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/setup#python

In order to combine stories of different files in a single CSV file, a script is also included [combine.py]

Main aim of the script was computing some statistics related to my master thesis as explained in a blog post.
